# CIEMAT: Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) Tool for Microgrid Resilience

## Overview

The Cyber-Informed Engineering Microgrid Analysis Tool (CIEMAT) was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER). This tool is developed to enhance the security and resilience of microgrid installations by incorporating Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) principles into the deployment and management of Microgrid energy systems, with a current focus on battery energy storge systems (BESS) often utilized at microgrid sites.

## Systematic Approach

CIEMAT operates through a systematic, multi-step process designed to deliver a thorough and utility-specific analysis:

1. **Analysis of System Services**: This initial step(s) involve a detailed selection and examination of the energy system’s operational services.
2. **Consequence-Focused Analysis**: In this step(s), the tool guides a user through a CIE consequence analysis to assess the potential impacts of system failures or cyber incidents in relation to organizational risk tolerances.
3. **Cyber-Informed Engineering Mitigation Analysis**: In the final step(s), the tool guides a user through a CIE mitigation analysis to identify mitigation opportunities to consider for the microgrid site installation.

## Roadmap

1. **Alpha Release** *(Current Stage)*
2. Incorporation of Cybersecurity Controls into the Mitigation sheet from well-known open standards, such as: NIST 800-53/82, NERC CIP, C2M2, IEEE 1547.
3. Development and incorporation of reference architecture and component analysis for additional common energy sources:
    - Photovoltaic (PV)
    - Wind
    - Synchronous Generators (e.g., Natural Gas, Propane)
    - To Be Determined (TBD)
