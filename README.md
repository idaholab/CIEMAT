# CIEMAT: Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) Tool for Microgrid Resilience

## Overview

The Cyber-Informed Engineering Microgrid Analysis Tool (CIEMAT) was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER). This tool is crafted to bolster the security and resilience of microgrid installations by incorporating Cyber-Informed Engineering (CIE) principles into the deployment and management of energy systems, with a specific focus on battery energy systems often utilized at microgrid sites.

## Systematic Approach

CIEMAT operates through a systematic, multi-step process designed to deliver a thorough and utility-specific analysis:

1. **Analysis of System Services**: A detailed examination of the operational services provided by the energy system.
2. **Consequence-Focused Analysis**: This step guides the user through a CIE consequence analysis to assess potential impacts of system failures or cyber incidents in relation to organizational risk tolerances.
3. **Cyber-Informed Engineering Mitigation Analysis**: The final step assists the user in conducting a CIE mitigation analysis, aiming to identify opportunities for mitigating risks at the microgrid site.

## Roadmap

1. **Alpha Release** *(Current Stage)*
2. Incorporation of Cybersecurity Controls into the Mitigation sheet from well-known open standards, such as:
    - NIST 800-53
    - NERC CIP
    - C2M2
    - IEEE 1547
3. Development and incorporation of reference architecture and component analysis for additional common energy sources:
    - Photovoltaic (PV)
    - Wind
    - Synchronous Generators (e.g., Natural Gas, Propane)
    - To Be Determined (TBD)
